            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has always fascinated me, how a few lines of code can create something impactful.
                    Hi, I'm Branenda Jordhy, an Informatics Engineering Student @ Bandung Institute of Technology,
                    diving into programming and development to explore it firsthand.
                    From writing my first lines of code to building small projects, every step is an opportunity to learn, experiment, and improve.
                    I enjoy solving problems, exploring new ideas, and seeing how technology can turn creativity into reality.
                    Every challenge is a chance to grow, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this path takes me.
